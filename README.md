# Imporve image loading with blurhash

Blurhash is a technique for encoding the visual representation of an image into a compact string of characters. This string, or hash, can be used to generate a low-resolution preview of the image, which can be displayed while the full-resolution image is still loading.

The main benefit of using blurhash is that it allows you to show a preview of an image before it fully loads, which can greatly improve the user experience. For example, when scrolling through a list of images, blurhash can be used to show a low-resolution preview of each image as soon as it comes into view, rather than waiting for the full-resolution image to load. This can make the list feel much more responsive and smooth.
